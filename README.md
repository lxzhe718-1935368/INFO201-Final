## Abstract

No more than three sentences that summarize your project. Focus on the very most important aspects. For example: (1) "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." (2) "We are concerned with ..., because .... To address this concern, we plan to ...." (3) "Consider that .... This is important because .... Accordingly, we plan to ...."

## Keywords

3-5 keywords that summarize your project.
(e.g., "Keywords: human physiology; bicycle exercise; Gen Z; times-series data")
Health, Heart Disease, Personal health condition

## Proposal

1. Introduction  

> Briefly introduce your project.  Include 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? (at least 200 words)
> top 3 key factor of heart disease, most common range of age, race of getting heart disease, relationipn between sleep, physical activity and heart desease. What other disease will likely cause heart desease.

2. Related Work  

> Heart disease is marked as one of the high-risk diseases for almost all age group, which might cause angina, congestive heart failure, and even death. The direct and/or indirect factors and indicators lead to heart disease are very, including smoking, drinking, sleep issue, poor diet, diabetes, family history, and so on. Our main goal for this project is to analyze some of the possible indicators mentioned above and summarize their relationships with heart disease as well as the influences with each other. Many research studies have done relevant work that exploring potential causes of heart disease based on massive data. In a study titled [“Type of Alcohol Consumed and Mortality from All Causes, Coronary Heart Disease, and Cancer”](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-133-6-200009190-00008), the researchers conducted several surveys about the alcohol consumptions with nearly 24,523 participants from the age of 20 to 98. The study found that the proportion of causing heart disease in the group of heavy drinkers has chance to be influenced by the type of alcohol consumed. Another research titled [“Patients' Beliefs about The Causes of Heart Disease: Relationships with Risk Factors, Sex and Socio-economic Status”](https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/13/5/724/5933248) also conducted similar survey about the patients’ own beliefs in the causes and mentioned that “higher socio-economic status patients were more likely to attribute heart disease to heredity and genetic factors.” Similarly, one study titled [“Fetal Origins of Coronary Heart Disease”](https://www.bmj.com/content/311/6998/171) also mentioned the relationship between genetic reason, fetal cycle, and the development of heart disease. All of the studies indicate that the causes of heart disease are not unitary. It’s necessary for us to put single indicator into a broader context and explore the relationship with not only heart disease itself but also other relative factors.

3. The Dataset
> We found the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease/code) from kaggle. Originally, the dataset comes from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), edited by KAMIL PYTLAK. Dataset collected by survey, by asking questions about people's health statu such as "Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?". Data was collected because heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US, and there are some key factors related to heart disease. So the dataset can be helpful for us to improve personal health and avoid heart disease. There are a total of 18 features and 319796 rows in the dataset; the original dataset from CDC has 401,958 rows and 279 columns. We think there are some limitations in this dataset. First of all, the dataset seems to only contain surveys from the U.S. but not other countries. Second, there are some columns such as general health, mental health and physical health, are really subjective. Those features do not have a standard and vary people by people. So those factor can cause some biased.  
> What, if any, ethical questions or questions of power do you need to consider when working with this data?  
> What are possible limitations or problems with this data?   (at least 200 words)

4. Implications

> Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (at least 150 words)

5. Limitations & Challenges
>What challenges or limitations might you need to address with your project idea more broadly? Briefly discuss. (at least 150 words)
> because the limitations in dataset that only contains people who live in U.S  so we can't make make full analysis for global area.
> Also because of some factor are subjective, the result is depend on people's own defination but not general stander. 

Acknowledgements
>Thanks to CDC and their work to provide data and import our health.
